            <div class="text">What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the
            1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of
            letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional
            'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as
            Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!.</div>
